# Egyptian Hieroglyph Lookup
HTML and Javascript lookup of Egyptian Hieroglyphs

I do not know where the PDF dictionary came from.  If you know, please let me know and I'll provide attribution.

hieroglyphs.js -- this is a Gardiner indexed map that provides the Unicode value and Gardiner category.

dictionary.js -- this is an indexed map of dictionary entries looked up by Gardiner codes 

entries.js -- this is an indexed map of values that return a list of Gardiner codes that can be looked up.

TODO: Need to do a dictionary lookup by "like" - as well as adding some kind of SQLite for a website.

Also add the other dictionaries I know of

fix display so the hieroglyphics can be stacked vertically and horizontally and in blocks as they would be in inscriptions
